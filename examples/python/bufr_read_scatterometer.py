# Python implementation:  bufr_read_scatterometer
#
# Description: How to read data for a given beam from scatterometer BUFR
#              messages.
#
# Please note that scatterometer data can be encoded in various ways in BUFR.
# Therefore the code below might not work directly for other types of messages
# than the one used in the example. It is advised to use bufr_dump first to
# understand the structure of these messages.

        # in each beam.
        #
