# Python implementation: bufr_read_synop
#
# Description: how to read data values from BUFR messages.
#

# Please note that SYNOP reports can be encoded in various ways in BUFR.
# Therefore the code below might not work directly for other types of SYNOP
# messages than the one used in the example. It is advised to use bufr_dump to
# understand the structure of the messages.

INPUT = "../../data/bufr/syno_multi.bufr"

def example():
    # open bufr file
    f = open(INPUT, "rb")

    # define the keys to be printed
    keys = [
        "blockNumber",
        "stationNumber",
        "latitude",
        "longitude",
        "airTemperatureAt2M",
        "dewpointTemperatureAt2M",

        "#2#cloudType",  # cloud type (middle clouds)
        "#3#cloudType",  # cloud type (highclouds)
    ]

    # The cloud information is stored in several blocks in the
    # SYNOP message and the same key means a different thing in different
    # parts of the message. In this example we will read the first
    # cloud block introduced by the key
    # verticalSignificanceSurfaceObservations=1.
    # We know that this is the first occurrence of the keys we want to
    # read so in the list above we used the # (occurrence) operator
    # accordingly.
