6 6 PIXEL IS AFFECTED BY RADIO-FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE
7 7 POOR CALIBRATION QUALITY DUE TO BAD SPACE VIEW OFFSETS, OBC * VIEW OFFSETS, ETC. OR USE OF A PREVIOUS CALIBRATION VIEW
8 8 SATURATED PIXEL
9 9 MISSING DATA -DATA REQUIRED FOR CALIBRATION PROCESSING ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR PROCESSING
10 10 CALIBRATED PIXEL RADIANCE OUT OF RANGE
11 11 CALIBRATED PIXEL REFLECTANCE OR EBBT OUT OF RANGE
12 12 THE MOON HAS CORRUPTED THE SPACE VIEW
13 13 SCAN DATA IS NOT PRESENT (NO VALID DATA)
14 14 QUALITY FOR THIS SCAN-LINE IS REDUCED. THE VALUE IS DETERMINED BY THE COMBINED NUMBER OF STEPS REQUIRED TO FIND A REPLACEMENT FOR THERMISTOR OR CALIBRATION SOURCE DATA
15 15 BAD DETECTOR
