1 1 Delta functions with spatially variable concentration and fixed diameters Dl (p1) in metre 
2 2 Delta functions with spatially variable concentration and fixed masses Ml (p1) in kg 
3 3 Gaussian (normal) distribution with spatially variable concentration and fixed mean diameter Dl(p1) and variance(p2)
4 4 Gaussian (normal) distribution with spatially variable concentration, mean diameter and variance 
5 5 Log-normal distribution with spatially variable number density, mean diameter and variance
6 6 Log-normal distribution with spatially variable number density, mean diameter and fixed variance(p1)
7 7 Log-normal distribution with spatially variable number density and mass density and fixed variance(p1) and fixed particle density(p2)
8 8 No distribution function. The encoded variable is derived from variables characterized by type of distribution function of type No. 7 (see above) with fixed variance(p1) and fixed particle density(p2)
