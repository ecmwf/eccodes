# NOTE fckit is present because it bundles intel fortran libs in, which eccodes fortran also needs. There is no code
# dependency. We could have instead bundled fortran libs in here as well, but that would result in bloated wheels and
# perhaps conflicts -- thus we opt for a hack (temporary anyway as eventually fortran will fade out)
# NOTE we have eckit dependency here already, but it's not actually used during compilation -- the reason is that
# the dependency resolution during install cannot well resolve transitive dependencies yet, and fckit does depend on
# eckit
