ecCodes is a package developed by ECMWF which provides an application programming interface
and a set of tools for decoding and encoding messages in the following formats:

   * WMO FM-92 GRIB edition 1 and edition 2
   * WMO FM-94 BUFR edition 3 and edition 4
   * WMO GTS abbreviated header (only decoding)

A useful set of command line tools provide quick access to the messages.
C, Fortran 90 and Python interfaces provide access to the main ecCodes functionality.

ecCodes is an evolution of GRIB API.
It is designed to provide the user with a simple set of functions to access data from
several formats with a key/value approach.
